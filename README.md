Asteroids_Game
==============

A small game I made for an extra curricular at UBCO

This code was written in C for the MPG Level 1 Atmel board using drivers written by Sheldon Patterson.  It is a game involving the player dodging and destroying "asteroids" coming from the right side of the screen.  Asteroids are semi-randomly generated and the game speeds up over time.  The game is still buggy but I think it is interesting enough.

I wrote the all of the code within the for(;;) loop except for lines 142 to 145.  I also defined all the constants, types, variables, and private functions.  Other code was written by Sheldon Patterson
